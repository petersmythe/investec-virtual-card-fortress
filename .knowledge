### Investec Card IDE `env.json` limitations

* The `env.json` file can not store JSON objects or arrays and is best suited to store individually named key-value string pairs.

* A workaround is to store a full JSON object at the top of `main.js`, perhaps separated from the rest of the code with a warning

`// DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE BELOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING`
